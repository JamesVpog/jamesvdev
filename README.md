# James Vongphasouk's blog and portfolio (blogfolio!)

Hi, welcome to my blogfolio's source code. Run the following commands to host locally:

`npm install` 
`npm run dev`

## Tech

I used [11ty](https://11ty.dev) prior, but I wanted to try dipping my toes in 
[Astro](https://astro.build). 90% of it comes from not wanting to relearn nunjucks and the other
10% comes from my seeing Astro in the wild wild west of Reddit.

## Helpful links I used to create the site

I don't want to rewrite workflows or explain each part of *my* site. Instead, I'll just
link the official docs I used to get up and running:

- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)
    - [Deploy to Github Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/)
- [Where I bought my domain (not sponsored)](https://www.namecheap.com/)
- [The reddit post that started it all for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrojs/comments/1mfe9h1/astro_vs_hugo/)
    - [Impressive performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrojs/comments/1o08rvm/99_score_with_a_hero_carousel_and_videos_astro_is/)
- More links to come as I build
